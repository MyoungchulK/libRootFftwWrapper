Introduction
===============
This is a simple wrapper library that provides an interface to FFTW for use with ROOT. 

Prerequisities
===============
ROOT (http://root.cern.ch)
FFTW3 (http://www.fftw.org/)


Making  and Installing
======================
i) Install both ROOT and FFTW3 are on your system and that ROOTSYS is correctly set (or root-config is in your path) and that the directory containing libfftw3 is in either the system or your own LD_LIBRARY_PATH.
ii) Edit the site specific section at the top of the Makefile (in general only the install variables need to be set)
iii) To make type:
make
iv) To install in another directory (if desired) type:
make install

Usage from within ROOT
=======================
a) Ensure that the directory containing libRootFftwWrapper.so is in your LD_LIBRARY_PATH.
b) To load trhe library you can:
gSystem->Load("libRootFftwWrapper.so");
c) The FFTWComplex and FFTtools classes should now be accessible from the ROOT prompt or ROOT macro.

FFTtools Description
======================
All of the FFTtools functions as static meme=ber functions so they can be called without instantiating the class. Typical usage is:
TGraph *grPowerSpectrum = makePowerSpectrum(grInput);
where grInput is a pointer to a TGraph containing the input waveform.

Most of the member functions have fairly descriptive names, the documentation is at present somewhat lacking.
